## Introduction
<b>Problem Statement:</b> Effectively Identifying Donors for mailing campaigns and forecast/predict the expected total donations receivable from these campaigns <br>
<br>
# Goals:
<b>1. Targeting Donors: </b>Identifying donars who are most likely to donate in response to a mailing campaign <br>
<b>2. Donation Prediction: </b>Estimating the total revenue from the mailing campaign <b>
<br>

## Folder Structure
- `data/`: Contains the datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter Notebooks for each step of the analysis.
- `scripts/`: Contains .py scripts used for data processing, analysis and building predictive models.
- `models/`: Contains saved models.
- `results/`: Contains generated figures and results from the analysis.

## Data Description

The dataset used in this project contains information about past marketing campaigns and donor behaviors. The main columns in the dataset include:

- `donated`: Binary target variable indicating donor (1) or non-donor (0) which was feature engineered considering other donations.
- `TARGET_D6`, `TARGET_D12`, `TARGET_D18`, `TARGET_D24`: Target variables indicating the amount of donation over 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, respectively.
- Various features such as demographic information, past donation behavior, and campaign interactions.

## Installation

To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kaushik-holla/market_campaign_analysis.git
cd market_campaign_analysis
```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate 
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage


## Models and Techniques
### Classification

XGBoost Classifier: Used to classify donors and non-donors with a focus on maximizing recall.
SMOTE and Downsampling: Techniques used to handle class imbalance.

### Regression
XGBoost Regressor: Used to predict the amount of donations over different periods (6, 12, 18, and 24 months).
GridSearchCV: Hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.

## Results
The results of the classification and regression models, including evaluation metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, MSE, and RÂ² score, are documented in the respective Jupyter notebooks and the results section of the project.

## Classification Report

### Example of a Classification Report

The classification report provides detailed metrics on the performance of the classification model. The metrics include precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class. Below is an example of a classification report generated from the model:

```mathematica
              Precision    Recall  F1-score   Support

           0       0.98      0.69      0.81      3782
           1       0.12      0.79      0.20       197

    accuracy                           0.69      3979
   macro avg       0.55      0.74      0.51      3979
